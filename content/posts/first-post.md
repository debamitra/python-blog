Python is the go-to language for AI, Web, Automation etc for a lot of the tech world. I have been working in the python ecosystem for a few years now and I want to really dig deep and gain mastery over the language. I want to use this diary to follow me on my learning journey, making it feel more alive - something for me to look back on in the future.

Here, I may talk about my reflections, logs, experiments, struggles, questions and understanding.

So, lets go. :)
